    <h2>About This Application</h2>
    <p>
      This application is distributed as a Windows executable (.exe) file and is
      intended to be used as a local desktop utility. It is not a web
      application. All OAuth 2.0 authentication flows are initiated locally, and
      the user's default browser is used during the sign-in process.
    </p>

    <p>
      The application accesses Google Calendar data only to identify events used
      to classify and move local files on the user's system. No data is
      transmitted or stored externally, and all operations take place locally on
      the user's device.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please refer to the demo video and screenshots above to understand how the
      application works in its actual runtime environment.
